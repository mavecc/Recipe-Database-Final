# Recipe-Database-Final

For this program to work, it needs to have a "database.csv". 
This will automatically be created with three sample websites include inside sitemapimport.py, but these websites can be changed inside the file. 
The database itself can be updated either by running sitemapimport.py directly, or by re-initializing the database through the main program.
Re-initializing will cause the program to freeze before redirecting the user to the main list menu.
